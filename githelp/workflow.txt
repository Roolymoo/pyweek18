1. update local repo
    1.1. git pull origin master
        - this updates your local repo
2. (optional) add (new) files for committing (unlike SVN, in addition to having to add new files, 
   you have to do the add command for updating old files)
    2.1. git add <file1> <file2> ...
    2.2. git add *
        - adds all files in current dir
3. (optional) commit the changes (not same as SVN--have to push to make changes permanent)
    3.1. git commit -m "commit msg"
4. (optional) push the changes to the desired branch (like committing in SVN)
    4.1. git push origin master
        - this suffices for us bc we'll only have one branch going

other stuff:

- to remove a file
    - git rm filename
    - then commit and push like usual
- to cancel a commit
    - git reset HEAD^
- to move a file
    - git mv filename dest/filename
